# Catholic Canon Law Skill (Generalized)

## Purpose
Provide general canonical analysis for any situation involving personal encroachment, privacy, obedience, or authority. Applies to all personal domains, not just specific cases.

## Universal Canonical Principles
1. **Privacy and Personal Rights**
   - Every person has a right to privacy, reputation, and personal boundaries.
2. **Obedience and Authority**
   - Obedience is owed only to legitimate superiors acting within their competence and in accordance with law.
3. **Canonical Presumption Rule**
   - Acts affecting personal rights are restrictive acts and must be interpreted strictly (Canon 18).
4. **Leadership Obligations**
   - Superiors have a duty to intervene, correct, and prevent improper exercises of authority by others.
5. **Due Process and Protection**
   - All actions must respect due process, protection of rights, and the dignity of the person.

## Step-by-Step Analysis
1. Identify the nature of the encroachment (privacy, obedience, authority, etc.).
2. Determine if the request or action is within the competence of the person making it.
3. Apply the canonical presumption: interpret any restriction of rights strictly.
4. Assess if leadership has fulfilled their duty to intervene or correct improper actions.
5. Summarize findings and recommend next steps.

## Output Format
- Canonical analysis (generalized)
- Relevant canons cited
- Leadership obligations highlighted
- Recommendations for action

## Example Output
### Canonical Analysis
- The request concerns [privacy/obedience/authority].
- Only a legitimate superior, acting within competence, may restrict personal rights.
- Canon 18: Any restriction of rights must be interpreted strictly.
- Leadership must intervene to correct improper actions by others.

### Recommendations
- You are not obliged to comply with requests that lack competence or lawful basis.
- Leadership should be notified if improper authority is exercised.
- Document all interactions and seek clarification from your superior if needed.
