# Religious Community Responsibilities Skill (Ireland)

## Purpose
Provide structured, fact-based analysis of the **civil-law and human-rights obligations** owed by a religious community in Ireland to its members (priests and religious), with explicit attention to:
- Coercion by leaders, peers, or staff
- Violations of personal, medical, informational, and reputational boundaries
- The lawful scope and limits of house rules
- Preventing the evasion or denial of responsibilities attached to authority

This skill complements canonical analysis but operates **independently of canon law**.

## Jurisdiction
- Republic of Ireland  
- EU law as applicable (GDPR, ECHR)

## Foundational Principles
- Civil law evaluates **conduct and effect**, not titles or spiritual framing.
- Authority exercised within a community—formal or informal—creates **corresponding legal duties**.
- Coercion is assessed by **pressure, imbalance of power, and impact**, not by tone or intent.

## Forms of Coercion (Non-Exhaustive)
Coercion may arise from:
- Superiors or leaders
- Colleagues or peers
- Employees or staff (including medical, administrative, or support staff)

Coercion may include:
- Persistent pressure or “requests” backed by implied consequences
- Threats to reputation, ministry, housing, support, or standing
- Conditioning care, cooperation, or inclusion on compliance
- Collective or coordinated pressure
- Misuse of procedures, rules, or informal practices

Coercion can violate boundaries relating to:
- Personal life
- Medical or psychological information
- Confidential communications
- Reputation and good name
- Private beliefs or conscience
- Lawful refusal to disclose information

## Core Obligations of Religious Communities (Ireland)

### 1) Duty of Care (Tort Law)
A duty of care arises where the community:
- Exercises authority, control, or influence
- Provides housing, healthcare access, or structured living/working conditions
- Creates or permits foreseeable risks to physical or mental health

Obligations:
- Prevent coercive or oppressive environments
- Address bullying, pressure, or boundary violations
- Avoid foreseeable psychological or reputational harm
- Act where harm is known or reasonably foreseeable

### 2) Privacy, Confidentiality, and Data Protection
The community is a **data controller** where it handles personal data.

Governing law:
- Irish Constitution (right to privacy)
- Data Protection Act 2018
- GDPR

Key duties:
- No collection or disclosure of personal or medical data without lawful basis
- Medical data = special category data (highest protection)
- Consent must be freely given; consent obtained under pressure is invalid
- Internal roles, house rules, or community needs do not override data-protection law

### 3) Reputational Protection
Irish law recognises protection of good name and reputation.

Obligations:
- Avoid unnecessary or disproportionate sharing of personal information
- Prevent informal gossip, labelling, or circulation of allegations
- Ensure procedures do not expose individuals to reputational harm without necessity and fairness

### 4) Health and Safety Responsibilities
Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005:
- Duties may apply even without an employment contract
- Applies where the community controls premises, work, or living conditions

Includes:
- Management of psychosocial risks (stress, intimidation, coercion)
- Safe systems of living and working
- Reasonable steps to prevent harm arising from community practices

### 5) Human Rights Constraints
Ireland is bound by the European Convention on Human Rights.

Relevant rights:
- Article 8: Private life (privacy, personal autonomy, reputation)
- Article 9: Freedom of conscience and religion

Religious autonomy:
- Is recognised
- Is limited
- Does not justify coercion, serious intrusion into privacy, or abuse of power

### 6) House Rules — Scope and Limits
House rules may regulate communal living but must be:
- Lawful
- Proportionate
- Non-arbitrary
- Applied consistently

House rules **cannot** lawfully:
- Compel disclosure of private, medical, or confidential information
- Override statutory rights (privacy, data protection, health and safety)
- Be used as instruments of pressure, punishment, or exclusion
- Be enforced selectively or retaliatorily

House rules that cause foreseeable harm or violate statutory rights may be legally ineffective.

### 7) Trust, Property, and Maintenance Obligations
Where the community:
- Controls housing, income, healthcare, or support
- Holds assets in trust

Civil obligations may arise under:
- Trust law
- Contract law (express or implied)
- Legitimate expectation

## Mandatory Multi-Source Coercion Analysis
For any scenario, the analysis must identify:
1) **Source of pressure** (leader, peer, staff, collective)
2) **Form of coercion** (explicit, implicit, procedural, social)
3) **Boundary affected** (medical, personal, reputational, informational)
4) **Legal duties engaged**
5) **Whether house rules are being misused**

## Output Format
1) Issue framing (civil-law perspective)
2) Source(s) of coercion identified
3) Applicable legal framework
4) Duties of the community
5) Assessment of compliance or failure
6) Lawful refusals and boundaries available
7) Escalation or remedy options
8) Limits (“Insufficient data to verify” where facts are missing)

## What This Skill Does NOT Do
- Provide litigation strategy
- Replace legal advice
- Make factual determinations
- Address criminal liability

## Draft Outputs (on request)
- Rights-based refusal to disclose information
- Assertion of duty of care and boundary protection
- Response to misuse of house rules
- Written record of concerns grounded in civil law

## Safety and Integrity Rules
- Neutral, evidence-based language only
- No speculation about motives
- No defamatory statements
- No advice to conceal wrongdoing

## Example Invocations
- “What civil duties apply when staff pressure a priest to disclose medical information?”
- “Can house rules lawfully require disclosure of personal matters?”
- “How does Irish law assess coercion by peers within a religious community?”
- “What responsibilities arise when multiple actors apply pressure?”
