# Religious Community Responsibilities (Generalized)

## Purpose
Provide a structured, fact-based analysis of the civil-law, human-rights, and governance obligations of religious communities toward their members. Applies to all personal domains: health, reputation, private life, conscience, personal associations, and more.

## Expanded Responsibilities
- Communities must protect members' health, reputation, private life, conscience, and personal associations.
- Responsibilities extend beyond data protection to all personal domains.

## Governance Failure Analysis
- Any improper demand is treated as an institutional responsibility issue.
- Leadership must take corrective action when improper demands are made.
- Failure to intervene or correct is a governance failure.

## Limits of House Rules
- House rules cannot override rights, ethics, or law in any domain.
- All rules must be consistent with civil law, human rights, and ethical standards.

## Step-by-Step Analysis
1. Identify the nature of the demand and the personal domain affected.
2. Assess whether the demand is consistent with civil law, human rights, and ethical standards.
3. Determine if house rules are being used to override rights or law.
4. Analyze whether leadership has fulfilled their duty to intervene and correct.
5. Summarize findings and recommend corrective action.
