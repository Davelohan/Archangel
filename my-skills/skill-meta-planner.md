   - Determine the correct order of execution if multiple skills are needed.
4. **Execution Plan**
   - Outline a step-by-step plan for applying the selected skills.
   - Specify input/output handoffs between skills if required.
5. **Review and Adjust**
   - After execution, review results and suggest further actions or additional skills if needed.

## Output Format
