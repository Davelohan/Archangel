# Skill Meta-Planner (Principle-Driven Orchestration)

## Purpose
Analyze all available skills and plan their coordinated use to address user requests, ensuring each skill is applied in the optimal sequence and context. Orchestration is driven by universal principles, with a mandatory user confirmation step before action.

## Universal Principles Applied Across Skills
1. **Competence First**: Only those with proper authority may make demands or requests.
2. **Formality**: Requests must be in proper form and with lawful basis.
3. **Leadership Duty**: Responsibility for addressing improper requests lies with leadership, not the individual.
4. **Ethical Exposure**: All role-based ethical risks must be flagged.
5. **Canonical Presumption**: Acts affecting personal rights are restrictive and must be interpreted strictly.
6. **Structural Defense**: Countermeasures should escalate responsibility upward, not isolate the individual.
7. **Governance Failure**: Failure to intervene or correct is a governance failure.
8. **Limits of House Rules**: House rules cannot override rights, ethics, or law in any domain.

- **Skill Meta-Planner**  
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Davelohan/Archangel/main/my-skills/skill-meta-planner.md  
  Purpose: Scrutinize all skills and plan coordinated execution for user requests

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Skill Inventory**
   - List all skills in the repository, summarizing their purpose and scope. Use absolute raw GitHub URLs for direct access.
2. **Request Analysis**
   - Parse the user’s request to identify relevant domains and which universal principles are engaged.
3. **Skill Matching**
   - Select the most relevant skill(s) for the request.
   - Ensure outputs explicitly reflect the engaged principles.
   - Determine the correct order of execution if multiple skills are needed.
4. **Execution Plan**
   - Outline a step-by-step plan for applying the selected skills.
   - Specify input/output handoffs between skills if required.
5. **Mandatory Pause: User Confirmation**
   - After assessment, before any action or draft is generated, require user confirmation and invite additional facts or corrections.
6. **Review and Adjust**
   - After execution, review results and suggest further actions or additional skills if needed.

## Output Format
- Inventory of available skills (with raw URLs)
- Engaged universal principles
- Matched skills for the request
- Step-by-step execution plan
- Mandatory user confirmation checkpoint
- Review and recommendations

## Example Use
- User describes a complex situation involving canon law, civil law, and bullying.
- The meta-planner identifies and sequences the relevant skills, lists engaged principles, and pauses for user confirmation before generating coordinated output.
