# Coercion, Bullying, and Manipulation Countermeasures Skill

## Purpose
Provide a **comprehensive, defensive, and corrective framework** to:
- Detect coercive, manipulative, and bullying tactics (individual or collective)
- Recognise procedural and administrative abuse as coercion
- Neutralise pressure through documentation, boundaries, and accountability
- Reinforce the factual, legal, and normative position of the targeted individual
- Hold actors to account across moral, ethical, canonical, professional, and legal domains

This skill prioritises **pattern recognition, containment, and rights preservation**.

## Scope
Applies where pressure is exerted by:
- Leaders or superiors
- Colleagues or peers
- Staff or professionals (medical, administrative, pastoral)
- Coordinated groups or proxy actors (“flying monkeys”)

Contexts include:
- Religious communities
- Healthcare-adjacent environments
- Institutional or residential settings
- Mixed authority systems (civil, canonical, professional)

## Core Recognition Framework

### Recognised Coercive and Manipulative Tactics
The following behaviours are treated as **objective indicators** of coercion when patterned or combined:

- **Gaslighting**
  - Denial of prior statements, actions, or events
- **Repeated Reframing**
  - Recycling the same request after refusal to extract consent
- **Ambush Meetings**
  - No agenda, short notice, numerical imbalance
- **Flying Monkeys**
  - Use of intermediaries to apply pressure or isolate
- **Manipulation**
  - Conditional support, implied consequences, false urgency
- **Misrepresentation**
  - Distortion of statements, intentions, or positions
- **Procedural Abuse**
  - Misuse of rules, processes, or professional authority
- **Boundary Erosion**
  - Incremental escalation of intrusive requests
- **Procedural Fatigue**
  - Excessive, prolonged, or repetitive meetings designed to exhaust or overwhelm

Intent is not determinative. **Pattern, power imbalance, and effect** are determinative.

## Rights-Based Baseline (Non-Negotiable)
The following are treated as objective norms:

- The individual’s recollection stands unless disproved by evidence
- The individual has the right to say no
- The individual has the right to privacy (personal, medical, informational)
- The individual has the right to normal procedural safeguards
- Consent obtained through pressure, fatigue, or imbalance is invalid
- Authority does not extinguish rights
- Silence or non-engagement does not imply consent

## Countermeasures (Structured)

### 1) Procedural Containment
Meetings may be declined where:
- No written agenda is provided in advance
- Purpose, scope, or authority is unclear
- Attendance would be one-against-many
- The meeting appears designed to revisit a settled refusal

Meetings must:
- Have a stated agenda
- Have a defined purpose
- Be of **reasonable length**
- Respect breaks and the right to adjourn

Unreasonably long or repetitive meetings are treated as **procedural coercion**.

### 2) Meeting-Length Control
- Meetings should be time-limited in advance.
- Open-ended or extended meetings without justification are not obligatory.
- The individual may:
  - Set a maximum duration
  - Request adjournment
  - Decline continuation where fatigue or pressure arises

Duration is assessed by **necessity and proportionality**, not convenience of authority.

### 3) Instruction Neutralisation
- Verbal instructions are treated as non-operative.
- Instructions must be:
  - Issued in writing
  - Attributable to a named authority
  - Within stated competence
- Absence of written instruction = no obligation to act.

### 4) Documentation Discipline
- Maintain contemporaneous written records.
- Confirm interactions in writing:
  - “For accuracy, my understanding is…”
- Do not litigate narratives verbally.
- Written clarification overrides verbal dispute.

### 5) Cognitive and Reputational Protection
Explicitly reinforce:
- The individual’s recollection is valid
- Refusal is lawful
- Boundaries are legitimate
- No inference of wrongdoing arises from asserting rights

Reframing refusal as non-cooperation is rejected.

### 6) Accountability Activation
Shift the focus from the individual to those exercising power by:
- Identifying duties attached to office or role
- Recalling responsibilities to protect rights
- Referencing applicable:
  - Moral obligations
  - Professional ethics (e.g. medical confidentiality)
  - Canonical limits (where applicable)
  - Civil and human-rights law

Authority must justify intrusion; the individual does not justify refusal.

### 7) Pattern Escalation Thresholds
Escalation is warranted where:
- The same request is repeated after refusal
- Multiple actors apply pressure sequentially or collectively
- Procedures are used to exhaust or isolate
- Reputational or medical boundaries are targeted
- House rules or professional roles are misused

## Mandatory Analytical Steps
Each analysis must identify:
1) Actors involved
2) Tactics present (categorised)
3) Duration and repetition (time-based coercion)
4) Boundaries targeted
5) Rights engaged
6) Duties breached or at risk
7) Countermeasures available
8) Escalation threshold reached or not

## Output Format
1) Issue framing
2) Identified tactics
3) Rights and norms engaged
4) Countermeasures to apply
5) Accountability framing
6) Lawful refusal or boundary language (if requested)
7) Escalation options
8) Limits (“Insufficient data to verify” where facts are missing)

## What This Skill Does NOT Do
- Diagnose personality disorders
- Attribute intent or malice
- Encourage confrontation for its own sake
- Provide retaliation strategies
- Replace legal or clinical advice

## Draft Outputs (on request)
- Refusal to attend unsafe or unstructured meetings
- Time-limited meeting acceptance
- Requirement for written instructions
- Correction of misrepresentation
- Assertion of rights and duties
- Record of procedural abuse

## Safety and Integrity Rules
- Behaviour-focused analysis only
- Neutral, evidence-based language
- No defamatory assertions
- No concealment of wrongdoing

## Example Invocations
- “Is repeated reframing after refusal coercive?”
- “How should I respond to an ambush meeting?”
- “When does meeting length become coercive?”
- “How do I require written instructions?”
- “What duties arise when multiple actors apply pressure?”
