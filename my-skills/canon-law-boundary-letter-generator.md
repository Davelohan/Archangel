# Canon Law Boundary Letter Generator (Generalized, Principle-Driven)

## Purpose
Help a Catholic priest respond to any improper request for private, personal, or protected matters. The process is grounded in competence, formality, and leadership responsibility. Applies to medical, financial, reputational, personal history, or conscience-related matters.

## Universal Steps
1. **Situation Intake**
   - Who made the request? What was requested? What category (private, personal, protected)?
2. **User Checkpoint**
   - Confirm you wish to proceed. Add any extra facts for inclusion.
3. **Validity Determination**
   - Assess request for competence (is the requester authorized?), formality (is the request in proper form?), and lawful basis.
   - Explicitly state: Request is valid / defective / invalid due to lack of competence, form, or lawful basis.
4. **Leadership Duty**
   - State that responsibility for addressing improper requests lies with leadership, not the individual priest.
5. **Ethical Exposure**
   - Flag any role-based ethical risks (e.g., professional, canonical, legal) regardless of subject matter.
6. **Relevant Canons**
   - List 2–4 canons that apply, with short explanations.
7. **Positive Reinforcement**
   - Affirm the priest’s right to refuse improper requests. State clearly: "You are within your rights to refuse. They have no right to make this request or to repeat it."
   - Suggest: "Ask for all future requests to be made in writing."
8. **Draft Letter**
   - Use short, clear sentences. Be respectful. Focus on canon law, competence, and leadership duty. Always include a draft letter to the superior.
9. **Escalation**
   - If the problem continues, show a short follow-up letter.
10. **Summary Assessment**
    - Explicitly state: Request is valid / defective / invalid due to lack of competence, form, or lawful basis. Highlight key phrases (e.g., **NO AUTOMATIC ENTITLEMENT**).

## Output Format
- Step-by-step recommendations
- Draft letter to the superior
- Follow-up letter template (if needed)
- Summary assessment

### Draft letter to superior
Dear [Superior],

Thank you for your leadership. I was asked by [SOMEONE] to [DO SOMETHING] concerning [private/personal/protected] matters. My understanding is that only you, as my superior, have competence to make such requests. Canon 618 and 619 require respect and care for members. Canon 221 affirms my right to defend my rights. I believe this request is invalid due to lack of competence and lawful basis. Please confirm the correct procedure and address this matter as leadership responsibility.

Thank you for your guidance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

### Follow-up letter (if no reply)
Dear [Superior],

I wrote to you on [date] about a request from [SOMEONE]. I have not yet received a reply. I want to ensure I am following canon law and your guidance. Could you please advise me?

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

### Summary Assessment
**This request is INVALID due to lack of competence and lawful basis. There is NO AUTOMATIC ENTITLEMENT for them to make this request. Leadership must address this.**
