# Canon Law Boundary Letter Generator (Enhanced)

## Purpose
Help a Catholic priest in a religious society draft respectful, canonical letters to leadership (not just the superior) that establish boundaries, externalize inappropriate conduct, and create a paper trail—without appearing confrontational or defensive.

## Step-by-Step Strategic Recommendations
1. **Situation Analysis**
   - Identify the request/demand and the actors involved (not just the superior).
   - Assess whether the request is canonically legitimate and who holds proper authority.
   - Explicitly analyze the conduct of others for procedural or canonical faults.
2. **Externalization of Fault**
   - Evaluate the actions/words of others for procedural, canonical, or ethical violations.
   - Avoid internalizing blame; focus on objective analysis of others' conduct.
   - Document patterns of overreach, procedural abuse, or inappropriate delegation.
3. **Canonical Framing**
   - Frame all correspondence as seeking clarity on canonical procedures and obligations.
   - Cite relevant canons and explain their application to the situation.
   - Redirect all improper requests to the legitimate authority.
4. **Drafting the Letter**
   - Open with gratitude and commitment to vocation and community.
   - State the situation neutrally, focusing on external facts and canonical process.
   - Clearly state that only the superior has authority to assign tasks.
   - Explicitly redirect peer or staff requests to the superior.
   - Cite 2–4 relevant canons with brief explanations.
   - Pose questions about canonical requirements, not personal circumstances.
   - Offer charitable interpretation but document procedural concerns.
   - Close with gratitude and a request for canonical clarity.
5. **Escalation**
   - If no response or continued issues, draft a follow-up letter to higher authority.
   - Reference prior correspondence and unresolved canonical questions.
   - Maintain respectful, non-confrontational tone.

## Output Format
