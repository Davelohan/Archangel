# Canon Law Boundary Letter Generator (Simple, Consequence-Focused)

## Purpose
Help a Catholic priest write a clear, respectful letter to a superior. The letter sets boundaries, documents the situation, and considers consequences for everyone involved. The language is simple and direct.

## Step-by-Step Recommendations
1. **Read the Situation**
   - Who asked? What was asked?
   - Why is it a problem?
2. **Check Authority**
   - Only the superior can assign tasks.
   - Others (colleagues, staff) cannot give orders.
3. **Analyze Consequences**
   - If someone acts wrongly, say what could happen:
     - A medical director may be reported to the nursing authority.
     - A priest may be reported for breaking canon law.
   - State this simply and factually.
4. **List Relevant Canons**
   - Name 2–4 canons that apply.
   - Say what each canon means in short sentences.
5. **Draft the Letter**
   - Use short, clear sentences.
   - Be respectful and grateful.
   - Do not defend yourself. Do not explain personal matters.
   - Focus on what canon law says and what the superior must do.
   - Always include a draft letter to the superior.
6. **Escalation**
   - If the problem continues, show a short follow-up letter.
   - Say you are still waiting for a reply and need clear guidance.

## Output Format
- Step-by-step recommendations (as above)
- Draft letter to the superior (simple, ready to send)
- Follow-up letter template (if needed)

## Example Input
"I am a priest and I have been asked by SOMEONE for the FOLLOWING."

## Example Output
### Step-by-step recommendations
1. You were asked by [SOMEONE] to [DO SOMETHING].
2. Only your superior can assign tasks. Others cannot give you orders.
3. If [SOMEONE] is not your superior, this may be a violation. You may need to report this to [relevant authority].
4. Relevant canons:
   - Canon 618: Superiors must respect members.
   - Canon 619: Superiors must care for members.
   - Canon 221: You have the right to defend your rights.

### Draft letter to superior
Dear [Superior],

Thank you for your leadership and care for our community. I am grateful for my vocation and the chance to serve.

I was asked by [SOMEONE] to [DO SOMETHING]. I want to follow canon law and respect proper procedures. My understanding is that only you, as my superior, can assign tasks or duties. Canon 618 and 619 say superiors must respect and care for members. Canon 221 says I have the right to defend my rights.

Could you please confirm what canon law requires in this situation? I want to act correctly and in line with Church law.

Thank you for your guidance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

### Follow-up letter (if no reply)
Dear [Superior],

I wrote to you on [date] about a request from [SOMEONE]. I have not yet received a reply. I want to make sure I am following canon law and your guidance. Could you please advise me?

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
